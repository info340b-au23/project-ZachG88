    <!-- Problem Description -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>It can be tough to find your ideal cup of coffee in today’s environment where the range of options is quite limitless. People who drink coffee can sometimes struggle to go through the various options to get something that suits their personal preferences. We suggest creating a web app for coffee preferences to solve this problem. Both coffee enthusiasts and beginners will benefit from this web app as it aims to improve and simplify the process of identifying what they want.</p>
            <p>Through the process of creating this web app, we plan to expand on previous web apps that attempted to offer suggestions based on the user’s coffee preferences. Websites like <a href="https://coffeebytheroast.com/coffee-match-quiz" target="_blank">Coffee By The Roast</a> have assisted users in figuring out their tastes in coffee and we’ve been inspired to create something similar. Our coffee preference web app will try to improve upon these existing websites by integrating a bigger dataset of coffee data to create better recommendations tailored to users' needs.</p>

    <!-- Proposed Application -->
    <section>
        <h2>Proposed Application:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Users of the coffee preference app will have access to a comprehensive database of coffee reviews and information sourced from the dataset available at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset/." target="_blank"> Kaggle</a> This dataset contains  reviews and ratings for various types of coffee. And also talks about the information about their origin, flavor, and brewing methods. Users will be able to explore and filter this data to view coffee preferences and recommendations based on factors such as milk preference, sweetness preference, and caffeine sensitivity. And we will use this external dataset to help analyze the relationship between different coffee and users' preferences.</p>
            <p>Using the coffee preference app will help solve the problem of users struggling to find the perfect coffee that matches their preferences and needs. The app will analyze users' input on milk preference, sweet preference, and sensitivity to caffeine and cross-reference this information with the dataset. This will enable it to suggest coffee varieties that align with users' specific tastes, ensuring a more enjoyable coffee experience.  Helping customers with difficult choices on coffee. Also, users will be able to explore more coffee options. Lots of people always get the same drink for a long time, our App will expand their coffee horizons and help discover new flavors.</p>
