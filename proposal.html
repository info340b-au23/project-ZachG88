        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>It can be tough to find your ideal cup of coffee in today’s environment where the range of options is quite limitless. People who drink coffee can sometimes struggle to go through the various options to get something that suits their personal preferences. We suggest creating a web app for coffee preferences to solve this problem. Both coffee enthusiasts and beginners will benefit from this web app as it aims to improve and simplify the process of identifying what they want.</p>
            <p>Through the process of creating this web app, we plan to expand on previous web apps that attempted to offer suggestions based on the user’s coffee preferences. Websites like <a href="https://coffeebytheroast.com/coffee-match-quiz" target="_blank">Coffee By The Roast</a> have assisted users in figuring out their tastes in coffee and we’ve been inspired to create something similar. Our coffee preference web app will try to improve upon these existing websites by integrating a bigger dataset of coffee data to create better recommendations tailored to users' needs.</p>
