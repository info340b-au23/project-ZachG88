        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                <h3> <em>How</em> do coffee-lovers find their roast? </h3>
            </p>
            <p>It can be tough to find your ideal cup of coffee in today’s environment 
                where the range of options is quite limitless. People who drink coffee can 
                sometimes struggle to go through the various options to get something that 
                suits their personal preferences. We suggest creating a web app for coffee 
                preferences to solve this problem. Both coffee enthusiasts and beginners will 
                benefit from this web app as it aims to improve and simplify the process of identifying what they want.
            </p>

            <p>Through the process of creating this web app, we plan to expand on previous web 
                apps that attempted to offer suggestions based on the user’s coffee preferences. 
                Websites like <a href="https://coffeebytheroast.com/coffee-match-quiz" target="_blank">Coffee By The Roast</a> 
                have assisted users in figuring out their tastes in coffee and we’ve been inspired to create something similar. 
                Our coffee preference web app will try to improve upon these existing websites by integrating a bigger dataset 
                of coffee data to create better recommendations tailored to users' needs.

    <!-- Proposed Application -->

    <section>
        <h2>Proposed Application:</h2>
        <div>

            <p>
                Our intended and targeted users for our web application are those above the age of eighteen 
                that enjoy coffee and have regular access to the internet. Those who have an interest in coffee 
                may take particular interest in our web application’s features in assisting our users in potentially 
                finding their new favorite coffee and recommendations personalized per each of our features, specifically 
                a tailored questionnaire, geared towards understanding our users preferences, in order to give them the best 
                coffee recommendations. While a majority of our users will be individuals interested in learning more about 
                their coffee preferences, our web application will also provide any sort of user interested in learning more 
                about coffee in general, the tools and resources to do so, allowing our web application to be a universal platform 
                for all coffee lovers. 
            </p>
                Upon entering our web application users will first see our home page that introduces our brand, provides a brief 
                description of what we have to offer, and a link directly to our main feature. Our main feature, with the goal of 
                attracting most of our users, is our questionnaire geared towards understanding our user’s preferences and upon submission, 
                providing our users with a tailored response with new coffee that may be of interest to them based on their flavor 
                preferences and other information they provided to our team within the questionnaire along with different blends our 
                users can create on their own. This will be able to provide our users with the personalized recommendations we know 
                they will love. Another page within our web application will be a menu of coffee items that our users will be able to 
                search or filter through. If users are searching for a specific coffee bean or type, they will be able to type the name 
                into the search bar, which will filter out their desired coffee. From the same page, users will be able to filter out coffees 
                based on the type of roast, the nodes, and more. If a user finds a coffee they love and would like to save it, they will
                also be able to have the option to heart their favorites, which will then save their favorite items in another window for 
                easy access. If our users would like to  learn more about what they can make with coffee beans or a coffee machine, we will 
                also have a discover and learn page that will provide our users with recipes and diagrams on how to make different types of 
                coffees with simple recipes. With these features combined we hope to provide our users with the best types of coffee recommendations, 
                personalized results, a menu of coffee items  and easy access to the coffees we know they will love. 
            <p>

            <p>Users of the coffee preference app will have access to a comprehensive 
                database of coffee reviews and information sourced from the dataset available
                at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset/." target="_blank"> Kaggle</a> 
                This dataset contains  reviews and ratings for various types of coffee. And also talks about the 
                information about their origin, flavor, and brewing methods. Users will be able to explore and 
                ilter this data to view coffee preferences and recommendations based on factors such as milk 
                preference, sweetness preference, and caffeine sensitivity. And we will use this external dataset 
                to help analyze the relationship between different coffee and users' preferences.
            </p>

            <p>Using the coffee preference app will help solve the problem of users struggling to find the
                 perfect coffee that matches their preferences and needs. The app will analyze users' input 
                 on milk preference, sweet preference, and sensitivity to caffeine and cross-reference this 
                 information with the dataset. This will enable it to suggest coffee varieties that align 
                 with users' specific tastes, ensuring a more enjoyable coffee experience.  Helping customers 
                 with difficult choices on coffee. Also, users will be able to explore more coffee options. 
                 Lots of people always get the same drink for a long time, our App will expand their coffee 
                 horizons and help discover new flavors.
